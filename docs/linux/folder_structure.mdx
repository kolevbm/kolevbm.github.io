# Filesystem Hierarchy

## Terminology

### daemon

A process which runs in the background and is not interactive

### Some important directories in the Linux filesystem:

     * `/`: Root directory, the starting point of the file system
     *  `/home`: Contains user-specific files and directories
     * `/etc`: Configuration files
     * `/var`: Variable files (like logs)
     * `/bin`: Essential command binaries (like ls, cp, etc.)
     * `/usr`: Contains user programs and applications

### Root Directory `/`

     The root directory is the top-level directory in the Linux file system. Everything in the system, including all other files and directories, is nested under `/`

## Important directories under **root**

### `/bin` (Essential User Binaries)

- This directory contains essential binary executable files (commands) required for the system to function, especially for all users.
- Commands like `ls`, `cp`, `mv`, `cat`, and `bash` are stored here.
- These commands are **available to all users** and are necessary even for single-user mode or minimal operating systems.

### `/sbin` (System Binaries)

- This directory holds essential system administration binaries. These are programs and commands intended for the root user or system administrators.
- Commands like `fdisk`, `mkfs`, and `shutdown` are stored here.

### `/etc` (Configuration Files)

- The `/etc` directory contains system-wide configuration files. These are text files that govern how different services and system components behave.
- Files in `/etc` control system startup, network settings, user management, and more.
- Example configuration files:
  - `/etc/fstab`: Configuration for mounting file systems.
  - `/etc/passwd`: Contains information about system users.
  - `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`: SSH server configuration.

### `/home` (Home Directories)

- This is where the user-specific directories are located. Each user on the system typically has a subdirectory under `/home`, like `/home/boris`, where the user can store personal files, settings, and configurations.

### `/root` (Root User’s Home Directory)

This is the home directory for the root user (the system administrator). It’s separate from `/home` because it has elevated privileges and is not typically shared with normal users.

### `/var` (Variable Data)

The `/var` directory contains files that change frequently, such as log files, temporary files, and cache data.
Some key subdirectories in `/var` include:

- `/var/log`: System and application log files.
- `/var/tmp`: Temporary files that need to persist after reboots.
- `/var/www`: Often used for serving web pages (on web servers like Apache or Nginx).

### `/usr`(User Programs)

This directory is for user-installed software and related files that are not essential for the system to boot. It contains many important subdirectories:

- `/usr/bin`: Non-essential binary files and user applications (like python, nano).
- `/usr/sbin`: Non-essential system binaries (for system admins, but not required for basic operation).
- `/usr/lib`: Libraries for programs in /usr/bin and /usr/sbin.
- `/usr/share`: Architecture-independent data (like icons, documentation, and locales).
- `/usr/local`: Locally compiled and installed software that is not part of the standard distribution.

### `/dev` (Device Files)

The /dev directory contains device files that represent hardware devices attached to the system. In Linux, devices like hard drives, USB drives, printers, and others are accessed as files.
Example devices include:

- `/dev/sda`: Represents the first hard drive.
- `/dev/tty`: Represents terminal devices.
- `/dev/null`: Represents a "bit bucket" where output can be discarded.

### `/proc` (Process Information)

The `/proc` directory is a virtual filesystem that provides information about system processes and kernel information. It does not contain real files but virtual files that represent the state of the system.
It contains information about running processes (e.g., /proc/1234 for process ID 1234) and system-level information such as:

- `/proc/cpuinfo`: CPU information.
- `/proc/meminfo`: Memory usage details.

### `/sys` (System Information)

- Similar to `/proc`, `/sys` is a virtual filesystem used to interact with the kernel and hardware components. It contains files and directories that allow user-space processes to access and control kernel parameters and device drivers.
- It’s primarily used for interfacing with devices, driver information, and kernel modules.

### `/opt` (Optional Software)

- The `/opt` directory is used to store third-party or optional software that is not managed by the system’s package manager (like APT or YUM).
- Software installed in `/opt` is typically manually installed by the user or downloaded as a self-contained application (like proprietary software or custom software packages).

### `/mnt` and `/media` (Mount Points)

- `/mnt`: A generic mount point where system administrators can temporarily mount filesystems (like external drives or network shares) for accessing files on those systems.
- `/media`: Similar to `/mnt`, but more often used for **automatically mounting removable media like USB drives**, CDs, or external hard drives
