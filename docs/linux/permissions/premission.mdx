# Basic overview of Linux permissions

each file and directory in Linux has a set of permissions

they are in the following order:

- `user` `group` `others` : the main three sets of permissions
- `rwx` `rwx` `rwx`: symbolic notation per group set
- `-rwxrwxrwx` : symbolic notation
- `777`: numeric notation

you can check the permission with `ls -l` command

```bash
ls -l
```

### What does `umask` do?

The `umask` (short for user file creation mask) value **subtracts** permissions from the default permissions of **newly created files and directories** from the user.

_Default permissions_ are:

- Files: 666 (read and write for all) by default, minus umask.
- Directories: 777 (read, write, execute for all) by default, minus umask.

```
 umask 022  # Sets default permission to 755 for directories and 644 for files
```

:::tip
Summary:  
if `umask = 022` you will get

`777 - 022 = 755` for newly created directories

`666 - 022 = 644` for new files
:::

### What is `chmod`

`chmod` (short for change mode) : Modifying Permissions on Existing Files and Directories

```bash
chmod [who][operator][permissions] filename
```

who - Specify User Categories

- `u`: User (owner of the file)
- `g`: Group (group members)
- `o`: Others (everyone else)
- `a`: All (user, group, and others)
  You can combine these values if needed. For example, ug would apply to both the user and the group.

operator - Define the Operation

- `+`: Add the specified permission(s).
- `-`: Remove the specified permission(s).
- `=`: Set the specified permission(s) exactly, overriding any existing permissions.
  permissions - Define Permission Types
- `r`: Read permission
- `w`: Write permission
- `x`: Execute permission

Add Read and Write Permissions for the Owner (User)

```bash
chmod u+rw filename
```

```bash
chmod 755 myfile    # Sets permissions to rwxr-xr-x for 'myfile'
chmod u=rw,g=r,o=r  # Sets permissions to rw-r--r-- for 'myfile'
```

### Symbolic notation

- `r` stands for read permission
- `w` stands for write permission
- `x` stands for execute permission
- `-` indicates no permission

For example, the permission string `-rwxr-xr--` can be broken down as follows:

- `-` : This indicates that it is a regular file (not a directory or special file).
- `rwx` : The owner has read, write, and execute permissions.
- `r-x` : The group has read and execute permissions, but not write.
- `r--` : Others have read permission only.

### Numeric notation

The main digits correspond to the following permissions:

- `4` : Read permission
- `2` : Write permission
- `1` : Execute permission
- `0` : No permission

if you want all the permissions you can add them up `4+2+1=7`

Here are all the possible numeric notations for each set:

- `0` : No permission (`---`)
- `1` : Execute permission (`--x`)
- `2` : Write permission (`-w-`)
- `3` : Write and execute permissions (`-wx`)
- `4` : Read permission (`r--`)
- `5` : Read and execute permissions (`r-x`)
- `6` : Read and write permissions (`rw-`)
- `7` : Read, write, and execute permissions (`rwx`)

Permissions are grouped into three sets:

1. **Owner permissions**: The first digit represents the permissions for the file's owner.
2. **Group permissions**: The second digit represents the permissions for the group that the file belongs to.
3. **Others permissions**: The third digit represents the permissions for all other users.

For example, the numeric permission `755` can be broken down as follows:

- `7` : The owner has read, write, and execute permissions.
- `5` : The group has read and execute permissions.
- `5` : Others have read and execute permissions.

This corresponds to the symbolic notation `-rwxr-xr-x`.
