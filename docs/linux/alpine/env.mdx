# Adding environment variables

To add environment variables in Alpine Linux, you can set them temporarily for the current session or configure them permanently. Here are the steps for both methods:

### 1. Temporarily Setting Environment Variables

This method is useful for one-time settings that only need to exist for the duration of your session.

```bash
export MY_VAR="value"
```

To verify the variable:

```bash
echo $MY_VAR
```

To get all environment variables:

```bash
printenv
```

:::note
This will remain valid only for the duration of the current shell session.

### 2. Permanently Adding Environment Variables

To make environment variables persistent across reboots or sessions, you can configure them in various ways depending on whether you want them for a specific user or system-wide.

#### a. User-Specific (Bash Shell)

#### b. System-Wide Environment Variables

For system-wide environment variables (available for all users), you can add them to /etc/profile or create a new file in /etc/profile.d/.

Open `/etc/profile` (or create a script in `/etc/profile.d/`):

```bash
sudo nano /etc/profile
```

Add your environment variables **at the bottom:**

```bash
export MY_VAR="value"
```

Save and exit the file.

To apply the changes **without rebooting**, run:

```bash
source /etc/profile
```

##### Alternatively, you can create a file under `/etc/profile.d/`, such as:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/profile.d/myenvvars.sh
```

Inside this file, add:

```bash
export MY_VAR="value"
```

Then save and exit the file. And run `source /etc/profile` to apply the changes.

:::tip
I prefer the `/etc/profile.d/` method because it keeps the `/etc/profile` file clean and organized.
And all custom variables are stored in separate files.
