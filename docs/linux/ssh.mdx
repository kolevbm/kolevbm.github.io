# SSH login with keys

## Copying Your Public Key Manually

The content of your `public_key` file must be added to a file at `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` (user home directory) on your remote machine somehow.
If the folder does not exist create it with `mkdir -p ~/.ssh` and then create the file with `touch ~/.ssh/authorized_keys`

```bash title="create folder on remote machine"
mkdir -p ~/.ssh
```

```bash title="create file on remote machine"
touch ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

```bash title="copy public key to remote machine"
echo `public_key_string` >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

:::note
you can also use `ssh-copy-id` to copy your public key to the remote machine
:::

```bash title="copy public key to remote machine with ssh-copy-id"
ssh-copy-id username@remote_host
```

:::tip
When you have a SSH key login setup and ready, it is good to disable password login
`PasswordAuthentication no` for all users inside `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` be sure you have `PubkeyAuthentication yes`
