# User management

## Create root user

### 1. Create user

First step is to create the user, use `adduser` or `useradd`,
with `passwd` you can change the password of the user

```bash title="add new user"
adduser boris
```

- `adduser` will prompt you for password

If you want to change the password of a user use `passwd`

```bash
passwd boris
```

### 2. Add user to sudoers

To add a user to `/etc/sudoers` list you must open the config file with `visudo` command as root

```bash title="open visudo"
visudo
```

when the sudoers config file is opened, add the following

```bash title="/etc/sudoers"
boris ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
```

:::warning
Never edit the sudoers with other tool, awlays use `visudo`
:::

:::info
when the console ends with `$` you are normal user and will need to use `sudo` _SuperUserDo_ or you can type `sudo bash` and the bash will open as root `#`
:::

### 3. Restrict SSH login as root

It is awlays a good idea to restrict SSH login as `root` everyone can brute force it, you can do this by changing the `etc/ssh/sshd_config`

add the following

```bash title="/etc/ssh/sshd_conf"
PermitRootLogin no
```

save the file, restart the ssh `systemctl restart sshd` and try to login via SSH as `root`
:::warning
Be sure you **have a root user with SSH access** before restricting the `root` login
