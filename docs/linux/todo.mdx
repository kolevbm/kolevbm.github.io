# Alpine linux

## Export default editor

before exporting it as an environment variable with `export` it is good to know the location of the bin / app
you can do it with `which` cmd.

- `which` : this command gives you the location of the bin

example:

```bash
alpine:~$ which nano
/usr/bin/nano
alpine:~$
```

```bash title="bash"
export EDITOR=/usr/bin/nano
```

## service status/start/stop/restart

in Alpine linux you can use the built-in [OpenRC](https://docs.alpinelinux.org/user-handbook/0.1a/Working/openrc.html)

Example:

```bash title="alpine"
rc-service <service> <start stop restart>
```

# background service
