# Basic commands

## Remove directory

remove all files and directories inside

```
rm -rf /path/to/directory
```

- `r`: recursive all data and directories inside
- `f`: force

## Disk free space

The `df` command is used to display information about the file system's disk space usage, including the total size, used space, and available space.

```bash title="disk free"
df -h
```

## Disk usage

The `du` command is used to estimate file and directory space usage. It shows how much space files and directories are using.

```bash title="disk usage"
du -h /path/to/directory
```

- `-h` human readable

## Continue running a command after closing SSH connection

When you close an SSH connection, processes running in that session will be terminated.
To prevent this, you can run processes in the background and detach them from the SSH session.

Using nohup (No Hang Up)
nohup allows a process to continue running after the SSH session is closed by ignoring the hangup signal (SIGHUP).

```bash title="nohup"
nohup your_command &> output.log &
```

- `&> output.log` will redirect both stdout and stderr to output.log. You can view this log later to check the output of your command.

The trailing `&` puts the process in the *background*.
After running this, you can *safely close the SSH session* and the *process* will *continue* to run in the *background*.
