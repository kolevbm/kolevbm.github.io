In the case of VTs with two secondary windings (one secondary winding for measurement, and
one residual voltage secondary winding also known as a tertiary winding), it is advisable to
connect a resistance to the terminals of the open delta connected tertiary windings of the three
transformers (see fig. 12 ). The advantage of this damping device is that it does not affect
measurement accuracy or introduce losses in normal (balanced) operating conditions, but only
in unbalanced conditions in order to damp the phenomenon.
The recommended minimum values for the resistance R and power PR of this resistance
are:

where:

Us : rated voltage of the VT secondary, connected to the resistance (V)
Pe : rated thermal burden of the VT secondary winding concerned by the resistance (VA).
The rated thermal burden (in VA) is the apparent power that can be supplied by the VT to the
secondary without exceeding the limits of normal temperature rise, without precision requirements.
Resistance R must be chosen to ensure permanent dissipation of power PR.
